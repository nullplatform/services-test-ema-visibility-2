# my-service

Template for new nullplatform `services-*` repositories: the CI every service repo needs and the minimal structure the agent runs. Everything specific to your service is yours to add.

## Start here

1. Replace `my-service` everywhere with your service slug (directory, `Dockerfile`, `mise.toml`, specs, `.github/workflows/*`):
   ```bash
   git mv my-service <slug>
   grep -rl my-service . --exclude-dir=.git | xargs perl -pi -e 's/my-service/<slug>/g'
   ```
   Then set the display name (`"name": "My Service"`) in `<slug>/specs/service-spec.json.tpl`.
2. Add the **Public ECR** service to the application in nullplatform. It creates the ECR Public repository and the publisher role; then set the secret and variable in [Publishing](#publishing).
3. Write your steps in `<slug>/scripts/` and wire them in `<slug>/workflows/*.yaml`; define attributes in `<slug>/specs/`.
4. Merge to `main` with a `feat:` or `fix:` commit: release-please opens the release PR, and merging it publishes the image.

## Layout

```
my-service/
  entrypoint/   entrypoint (agent calls it), service and link (route an action to its workflow)
  workflows/    one YAML per action: create, update, delete, link, link-update, unlink
  scripts/      the steps the workflows run (example is a placeholder)
  specs/        service-spec.json.tpl and links/connect.json.tpl
  values.yaml   static configuration for the workflows
Dockerfile      worker image on the shared worker-bridge base
mise.toml       run it on your machine as a package (`np package run`)
```

A custom action slug `foo` runs `workflows/foo.yaml`.

## Run locally as a package

`np package run` runs this service on your machine the way production does: a
local controlplane-agent that registers with the platform, spawns the worker
image built from this repo, and hands it every action routed to it. No cluster,
no publish. The two tasks in `mise.toml` are the whole contract with the CLI:

| Command | Runs | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `np package build --image` | `mise run build:image` | Builds `my-service-worker:dev` |
| `np package run` | `mise run run` | Builds the image, then starts the local agent |

Prerequisites: **Docker** with host networking (Linux as is; on Docker Desktop
enable *host networking*), **[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev)** (`mise trust` once
here), an **`NP_API_KEY`** for the agent to register with, and `np` from the
**alpha** channel, which carries `np package run`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.nullplatform.com/install.sh | VERSION=alpha sh   # ~/.local/bin/np
np package run --help                                                   # must list --no-forward-env
```

```bash
export NP_API_KEY=...
eval "$(aws configure export-credentials --format env)"   # cloud credentials as variables
np package run --log-level DEBUG                          # Ctrl+C to stop
```

The agent is tagged `package:my-service` and `local:<your user>`. It receives an
action only when the service's notification channel selects those tags, so
point a channel at `local:<your user>` to route work to your machine.

> **Tags decide who gets the work.** Never start a local agent with tags a
> production channel selects: it would receive production actions.

`np package run` forwards your shell's environment to the agent container,
minus what describes your machine (`PATH`, `HOME`, `DOCKER_*`, `KUBECONFIG`,
`AWS_PROFILE` and the other file-pointing AWS variables), and the `run` task
passes the same variables to the worker through an `NP_WORKER_RULES` entry.
Every secret in your shell crosses too, and is readable with `docker inspect`;
pass `--no-forward-env` to forward nothing.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NP_API_KEY` | required | The key the agent registers with (`--api-key` also sets it) |
| `NP_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Agent log level (`--log-level` also sets it) |
| `NP_PACKAGE_SLUG` | `my-service` | The slug in the `package:<slug>` tag, when published under another slug |
| `NP_LOCAL_USER` | `$USER` | The value of the `local:<user>` tag |
| `NP_AGENT_IMAGE` | `controlplane-agent:latest` | The agent image; needs worker rules (0.11.1+) |

The local run never changes what the platform runs. To ship the change, merge
it: the release publishes the image and registers the artifact.

## CI

| Workflow | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| branch-validation | PR | branch named `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…` |
| conventional-commit | PR | commit messages (release-please reads them) |
| shellcheck | PR | every bash script |
| trivy | PR | IaC misconfiguration and image scan, to the Security tab |
| beta | push to a `beta/**` branch | publish-test-image-oci: pushes `beta/<image>:test-beta-<name>-<short sha>` and registers it as a nullplatform artifact |
| release | push to `main` | release-please → build and push `vX.Y.Z` and `latest` to ECR Public → nullplatform artifact → GitHub release |
| auto-merge-release | after release | merges the release PR |
| dependabot | daily / weekly | base image and shared workflow bumps |

## Image tags

| Image | Moved by | Use it to |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-plugins/services/<name>:vX.Y.Z` | its release, once | pin an exact version |
| `agent-plugins/services/<name>:latest` | each release | follow the last released version |
| `beta/agent-plugins/services/<name>:test-beta-<branch>-<short sha>` | each push to a `beta/**` branch (`git push origin HEAD:beta/<name>`) | deploy a change to a test scope before merging it |

Beta images live in a separate repository that the beta role can write and the production role cannot, so a beta can never overwrite a released image. Only pushes to `beta/**` branches can assume the beta role, and the tag carries the commit SHA, so two branches never overwrite each other by accident. Nothing deletes beta tags: they are ephemeral by convention. Each beta is also registered as its own nullplatform oci_image artifact (the `beta/` repository, under `NP_ARTIFACT_NRN`), separate from the release artifact, so it can be deployed to a test scope from the platform.

## Publishing

After adding the **Public ECR** service to the application, set in this repository:

| Name | Kind | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `AWS_ROLE_ARN_ECR_PUSH` | secret | the publisher role ARN the Public ECR service returns |
| `NP_ARTIFACT_NRN` | variable | the NRN of the organization that owns the artifacts |

`ARTIFACT_NP_API_KEY` comes from the organization. The release checks all three before building and fails with a clear error if one is missing. Beta images assume the role in the organization secret `AWS_BETA_ROLE_ARN` (no role is written in the workflow) and need the service's `beta/` repository in ECR Public: without it the push fails with `repository does not exist`. In this template repository neither workflow runs.
